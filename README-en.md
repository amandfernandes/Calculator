This Python code represents a simple calculator that accepts user input to perform basic arithmetic operations. The program uses a main loop to continue prompting for inputs until the user decides to terminate it.

## üíª Prerequisites
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.12.0-14354C?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=white)

## ‚òï Using Calculator

To use Calculator, follow these steps:
1. Run the script: Calculator.py.
2. Enter a number when prompted.
3. Enter an operator (+, -, *, /) to perform the desired operation.
4. Enter the next number to complete the operation.
5. The result will be displayed, and you can continue performing additional calculations.
6. To exit the calculator, press Enter when prompted for the operator or enter a non-numeric value.

### Usage Example:

### Features and Highlights
- Invalid Input Handling: If the user enters a non-numeric value, they will be prompted to enter a valid number.
- Basic Arithmetic Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are supported.
- Division by Zero Prevention: If the user tries to divide by zero, an error message will be displayed.

### Known Issues
Currently, the project faces some difficulties that may be addressed in the future:
1. This code block prints an error message if the divisor (b) is zero but does not halt the program's execution.

2. User input is not fully handled for more complex expressions, leading to unpredictable results in some cases.

## üìù Notes:
- The calculator uses a continuous loop to allow the user to perform multiple calculations until choosing to exit.
- The code uses Python 3.10's new pattern matching syntax for cleaner code.
- The calculator handles various scenarios and provides informative error messages for better user interaction.

## üí° Ideas:
Here are some ideas to improve and expand this project in the future:
1. **Advanced Operations Support:** Add support for more advanced mathematical operations, such as exponentiation, square root, etc.
2. **Internationalization:** Add support for multiple languages, making the calculator accessible to users from different regions.
