This project is a simplified version of a calculator made in Python that accepts user commands to perform simple arithmetic calculations. The calculator is capable of performing the four fundamental operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program maintains a continuous cycle, requesting user inputs until they choose to end it.

## ‚òï How to use Calculator

To use Calculator, follow these steps:

**1. *Start the program:*** Run the Python script, Calculator.py, to start the calculator.

**2. *Enter the first number:*** The program will ask you to enter a number. Type a valid number and press Enter.

**3. *Choose the operation:*** Next, the program will ask you to enter an operator. The valid operators are '+' for addition, '-' for subtraction, '*' for multiplication, and '/' for division. Type the operator and press Enter.

**4. *Enter the second number:*** The program will ask you to enter a second number. Type a valid number and press Enter.

**5. *See the result:*** The program will perform the chosen operation on the two numbers and display the result.

**6. *Continue or exit:*** You can continue to perform more operations on the result or exit the program. To continue, repeat steps 3-4. To exit, type x when asked to enter an operator.

### Usage Example:
![resultadocalc](https://github.com/amandfernandes/Calculator/assets/144744139/6c3a33bc-e2c2-4cd4-b5db-9ff40e89d2b5)


### Error handling

The program has error handling for invalid entries:

- **Invalid number**: If you enter something that is not a number when asked to enter a number, the program will display an error message and ask you to enter a valid number.

- **Invalid operator**: If you enter something that is not a valid operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) when asked to enter an operator, the program will display an error message and ask you to enter a valid operator.

- **Division by zero**: If you try to divide by zero, the program will display an error message and restart.

### Known Difficulties
Currently, the project faces some difficulties that may be addressed in the future:
1. This block of code prints an error message if the divisor (b) is zero, but it does not automatically stop the execution of the program.

2. The user's input is not fully handled for more complex expressions, leading to unpredictable results in some cases

## üìù Notes:
- The calculator uses a continuous loop to allow the user to perform multiple calculations until choosing to exit.
- The code uses Python 3.10's new pattern matching syntax for cleaner code.
- The calculator handles various scenarios and provides informative error messages for better user interaction.

## üí° Ideas:
Here are some ideas to improve and expand this project in the future:
1. **Advanced Operations Support:** Add support for more advanced mathematical operations, such as exponentiation, square root, etc.
2. **Internationalization:** Add support for multiple languages, making the calculator accessible to users from different regions.
